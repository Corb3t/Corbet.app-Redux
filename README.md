# Corbet.app-Redux

**Description:** Corbet.app Redux is an attempt at recreating Corbet.app from the ground up using the skills I've learned on my webdev adventures! Since my portfolio was created around 2018, I've sharpened many of my webdev skills, which I use to help manage my community-based server for friends and family (Join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/X4NaWA7KUQ)).
